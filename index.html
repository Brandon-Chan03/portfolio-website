                        <p class="info-about-me">Hello! My name is <span>Brandon</span> and I've always enjoyed technology especially the coding behind how it all worked.  
                            My coding journey began back when I was <span>10 years old</span> when I discovered HTML and CSS.  Sadly, I had stopped
                            because back then 10 year old me didn't have the patience to code.  Since then I have been on and off coding.

                        <p class="info-continued">Fast forward 6 years to my Sophomore year of highschool I picked coding backup.  
                            I picked up HTML and CSS once again and became the Web Developer for my mom's business, updating her website regularly. 
                            This also gave me the opportunity to learn e-commerce and how themes are developed through my use of Shopify.  One year later,
                            quarantine hit and that gave me more time than ever to enhance my skills.

                        <p class="info-continued-2">Now in the present, I have had the opportunity to work on 2 freelance jobs.  One being a Web Developer
                            for my mom's business and my second being a Web Developer for a local Christian leadership forum. I've also worked on multiple personal
                            projects.
