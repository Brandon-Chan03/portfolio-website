                        <p class="info-about-me">Hello! My name is <span>Brandon</span> and I've always enjoyed technology especially the coding behind how it all worked.  
                            My coding journey began back when I was <span>10 years old</span> when I discovered <span>HTML and CSS</span>.  Sadly, I had stopped
                            because back then 10 year old me didn't have the patience to code.  Since then I have been <span>on and off</span> coding.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="info-continued">Fast forward <span>6 years</span> to my Sophomore year of highschool I picked coding backup.  
                            I picked up <span>HTML and CSS</span> once again and became the <span>Web Developer</span> for my mom's business, updating her website regularly. 
                            This also gave me the opportunity to learn <span>e-commerce</span> and how <span>themes</span> are developed through <span>my use of Shopify</span>.  One year later,
                            quarantine hit and that gave me more time than ever to <span>enhance my skills</span>.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="info-continued-2">Now in <span>the present</span>, I have had the opportunity to work on <span>2 freelance jobs</span>.  One being a <span>Web Developer</span>
                            for my <span>mom's business</span> and my second being a Web Developer for a <span>local Christian leadership forum</span>. I've also worked on multiple personal
                            projects.
